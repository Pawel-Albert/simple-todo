# Simple TODO app

## Project Description

> Project is a simple TODO app written in vanilla javascript.

> Main purpose of it was to learn some basic CRUD operations with use of local storage. My personal goal is not to be a frontend developer.

> In future this project will be done in one or two popular frameworks (same to just have a grasp of the technology and how it works).

> Current version should be visible here: simple-vanila-js-todo-app.netlify.app/

> Disclaimer: 
- Project is not ideal representation of how the code should be structured (I've experimented with different approaches to achieve same goal, just for learning purposes).
- HTML and CSS part was inspired (but not copied) by few TODO app tutorials (focus was only on js and DOM interaction).
- Project most likely will never by 100% finished (other than doing it in different flavor using react or angular) and there are few areas that could be fixed.
